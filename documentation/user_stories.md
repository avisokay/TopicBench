# User Stories for TopicBench

## User Story 1: LLM Developer
As an LLM developer, I want to evaluate the performance of my language model on the task of labeling keyword clusters derived from topic modeling. This will help me understand how well my model can interpret and generate meaningful labels for topics in computational social science datasets.

## User Story 2: Computational Social Scientist
As a computational social scientist, I want to use TopicBench to benchmark different LLMs on their ability to label keyword clusters. This will assist me in selecting the most suitable model for my research projects that involve topic modeling and text analysis.
